# Kickstarter-Challenge
## Overview of Project
	The purpose of this analysis is to analyze past Kickstarter Campaigns to best predict the client’s potential success or failure. Specifically, the client’s campaign came close to it’s $10,000 goal. However, the client would like to know more about how the launch date of a campaign and the goal amount impacted the success or failure of similar play Kickstarters. 
## Analysis and Challenges
	The Kickstart data was analyzed by examining the theater outcomes by launch date and the outcomes based on goal amount. 
### Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
	This was analyzed by filtering data by the category of theater and year. Then the data was tallied by the number of canceled, failed, and successful campaigns over the months of the year. 
#### Outcomes Based on Goals
	This was analyzed by categorizing the campaigns goals in logical increments and filtering the number of successful, failed, and canceled play Kickstarters. Then the percentage of each of the categories was calculated. 
## Results
Theater Outcomes by Launch Date 
![Theater Outcomes by Launch Date]( https://github.com/Mary-Wood/Kickstarter-Challenge/blob/main/Outcomes%20Based%20on%20Launch%20Date.png) 
shows that campaigns in May and June have a drastically higher success rate than those in other months. Generally, the number of canceled campaigns has a relatively stable baseline, with a slight peak in January. This data suggests that starting a campaign in May or June would present the highest likelihood for success. 
Outcomes Based on Goals 
![Outcomes Based on Goals](https://github.com/Mary-Wood/Kickstarter-Challenge/blob/main/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png) 
shows clear trends in the success and failure of campaigns. Campaigns $10,000 and lower were more likely to be successful while failure percentages increase most dramatically between $15,000 and 35,000 and higher than $45,000. In a small niche of $35,000-up to $45,000 campaigns are more likely to be successful. As such, the client’s goal of S10,000 appears to be very likely to be successful.
