# Kickstarter Challenge

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to predict the potential success of the client’s Kickstarter Campaign. Specifically, the client’s theatrical play campaign came close to it’s $10,000 goal. However, the client would like to know more about how the launch date of a campaign and the goal amount impacted the success or failure of similar play Kickstarters.

## Analysis and Challenges
The Kickstarter data was analyzed by examining the theater outcomes by launch date and the outcomes based on goal amount. 

### Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
The theater outcomes by launch date was analyzed by filtering data by the category of theater and year. Then the data was tallied by the number of canceled, failed, and successful campaigns over the months of the year. 

#### Outcomes Based on Goals
The outcomes based on goals was analyzed by categorizing the campaigns goals in logical increments and filtering the number of successful, failed, and canceled play Kickstarters. Then the percentage of each of the categories was calculated. 

## Results
* Theater Outcomes by Launch Date 
![Theater Outcomes by Launch Date]( https://github.com/Mary-Wood/Kickstarter-Challenge/blob/main/Theatre_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png) 
shows that campaigns in May and June have a drastically higher success rate than those in other months. Generally, the number of canceled campaigns has a relatively stable baseline, with a slight peak in January. This data suggests that starting a campaign in May or June would present the highest likelihood for success, but between April and July present more successful campaigns that the rest of the year. 

* Outcomes Based on Goals 
![Outcomes Based on Goals](https://github.com/Mary-Wood/Kickstarter-Challenge/blob/main/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)
shows clear trends in the success and failure of campaigns. Campaigns $10,000 and lower were more likely to be successful while failure percentages increase most dramatically between $15,000 and 35,000 and higher than $45,000. In a small niche of $35,000- $45,000 campaigns are more likely to be successful. As such, the client’s goal of S10,000 appears to be very likely to be successful. 

### Limitations
This data does not filter for country or region. As such, there may be other trends that could impact the client within her local area. Future research should examine the trends of launch date and outcomes based on goal amounts for the specific area which the client is launching her campaign. While this data does examine trends over months, it does not examine trends over the years. There may trends by year that may predict additional understanding in the specific theatrical play Kickstarter niche.
